- 👋 Hi, I’m @TomIceberg
- 👀 I’m always excited to connect with security engineers who are curious, puzzle-solvers at heart, and driven by pushing the boundaries of technology. I run a cybersecurity recruitment company called Iceberg, where I have the privilege of representing some of the best minds in technical security. If you’re passionate about cybersecurity and open to new opportunities, let’s connect

- 💞️ My goal is to be the cybersecurity recruiter you trust when seeking the best projects and companies to work with
